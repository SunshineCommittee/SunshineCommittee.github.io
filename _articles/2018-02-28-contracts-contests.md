With February coming to an end, it's time for a brief reflection on the month.

## Contests

Also, this weekend (March 2nd and 3rd), we will be participating in the [Mass DiGI Game Challenge][massdigi] with [gARden][garden]! This year, the contest is being held on Becker College's campus, so If you're in the Worcester area, come on and stop by! We'll have a demo build running, if you want to see some virtual plants for yourself! 

## Contracts

Secondly, and more importantly, we're thrilled to formally announce a new collaboration partner for [gARden][garden]. Please join us in welcoming Chelsea Saunders, aka PIXELATEDCROWN, aboard!

Chelsea is a wonderfully talented 3D artist, and as such will be helping us by producing the 3D art for [gARden][garden] as a contractor. So far, she's produced several adorable pots and plants for us, and we're excited to even more in the future.
