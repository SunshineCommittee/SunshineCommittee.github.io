Tomorrow, September 14th, we'll be tabling at [Boston Festival of Indie Games][bfig], sharing our space with Megan's other project, "Vestigial". 
As promised in the last post, here's a post telling you all where to find us. Other great tables include D13 for Sunburst Studios, D23, and Petricore at D25!
