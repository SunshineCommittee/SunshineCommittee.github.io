If you've been keeping up on your Sunshine Committee lore, you might recall that we mentioned [being scouted to do a week-long physical installation for Boston's Art Week][artweek] a few months ago. We've since avoided talking about it because it was presumed to be cancelled, and then *was* cancelled, due to the state of the world right now. But it's back! Albeit, in a much different form.

## When, Where and How
Instead of a physical art installation (which we have to admit seemed like a perfect fit for [gARden][garden]), we'll be "tabling" at a demo night hosted online by [Venture Cafe Cambridge][venture], on Thursday, May 7th from 5-8 PM EST!
 
We'll be showing off gARden in its current state, and will be happy to talk about our plans for it, about AR/Computer Vision in general, about our real-world garden, and most of all, about our pet tortoise.
 
The event is open to all members of the public, and will be conducted through a teleconferencing platform called ["Remo"][remo]. From what we can tell, Remo is like a server for multiple concurrent teleconference meetings, with a UI designed like a floorplan. You can drag your avatar from one "table" to another to drop in and out of the various meetings. Just like visiting tables at a traditional expo event, except, you know, incredibly online.
 
You can join the Remo server from here, via the top bar which reads, "Click here to join the Virtual Caf√© on Thursday at 3PM!":

That said, the hosts have a virtual gathering every Thursday, so if you visit that above link more than one week out, you might accidentally visit a different event! Which is fine with them, or so we're told.
 
We hope to see you there!
