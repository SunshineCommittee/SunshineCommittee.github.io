Today marks 1 year of extremely part-time development for [gARden][garden]! While it's definitely hard to maintain a steady trend of progress in addition to our full-time jobs, we wanted to share some info about where we are now, compared to then

As a recap, here's the original tweet and video I made to initially share the project with the world:

If I'm being honest, I think we laid a lot of excellent groundwork in that original hackathon. We had rudimentary marker tracking set up, and a rough plan for what the UI should be structured like. But we've been working away at some solid improvements.

## Plant Simulation

The biggest thing we've been working on has been plant simulation, which has largely been [Kelly's][contact] domain. 

In the video above, our plant was simply a pre-animated model, which meant that every plant lifecycle would be identical within a species. We felt that such a system didn't really encourage growing multiple plants, so we got very, very in to algorithmic botany. Kelly has previously written about that [here][lsys].
