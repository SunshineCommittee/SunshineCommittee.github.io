We're happy to say that we've made it through the first phase of [BostonFIG][fig] review process! We're one step closer to seeing you all at MIT this fall!

This first phase review was based entirely on a video submission about the game, so to celebrate, we thought it might be fun to break down the various pitches we've made so so far and critique them a bit.

## The First Pitch

This video was put together overnight as a submission application to the WPI Booth at PAX. The booth was student-run, and as such had a bit more of a relaxed set of criteria. Still, we wanted to keep our pitch as professional as we were able after about a month of development. So, we produced the following video:

We figured that our biggest selling point was the novel technology (Augmented Reality), so we went for a cold open that cut right to the chase. After 

Huge shoutout to [Matt Martin][matt] for making a backing track for us basically overnight. 


## The Second Pitch

This pitch was constructed for the [Mass DiGI Game Challenge][massdigi], and as such was decidedly more business oriented than the WPI booth submission. The slides have been reproduced in the gallery below, and can be [downloaded here][slides] if you want to see the embedded video/GIF images.
