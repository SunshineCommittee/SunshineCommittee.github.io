A stealth tactics party game for 2-5 players!

<!--more-->

Heist Night is a local multiplayer game of cops-and-robbers, with a turnbased stealth twist. Four players play as the team of thieves, while the fifth plays as the entire police force.
Players gather around the television and connect in using their mobile device as a controller, providing them each with a private screen, and allowing each player to sneak around without fear of screen-cheating!
No external app is necessary to play, so anyone on any device can join the fun!

Winner of the MassDiGI Game Challenge "Best College Alpha" Award in 2016, Heist Night was also chosen to be showcased at the 2016 Boston Festival of Indie Games.
